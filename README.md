# TDT4110 - Chess

A chess game I made with Python in TDT4110, to be played in console. The interface language is Norwegian. Everything is contained in one python file.

The functionality of en passant and castling are not implemented. The program features a (very) simple homemade AI (getAutoMove) which follows some general guidelines, as well as a small amount of randomness, to decide on a move. Game modes are Player vs. Player, Player vs. AI, AI vs AI.
